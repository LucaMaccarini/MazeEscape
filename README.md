# Description
This project is a simple video game developed in C++ without the use of a game engine, utilizing a basic graphics library that allows for polygon drawing. The player is trapped in a maze made up of multiple rooms, each with doors. The player can rotate in place to face different directions or move through the door in front of them.

At the top of the screen, there is a compass that shows the direction the player is facing. The compass changes color based on the proximity of the enemy:
- **Yellow**: The enemy is nearby.
- **Red**: The enemy is very close.

The goal of the game is to escape the maze before the enemy catches you!
